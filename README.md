## Results

* The folder [Results](Results) contains the results of each figure in the numerical experiments in the main body of the paper.
* Due to the random nature of the simulation experiments and the absence of fixed random seeds in the code, the results may vary slightly when reproducing the experiment.
* Each row of the matrix corresponds to the numerical results of *EA*, *OCBAm*, *OCBAm+*, *OCBAss*, *OCBASS*, and *AOAm*, respectively.
